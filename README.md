# Helper Endpoint for my own Google Apps (Google Docs, etc)

I coded a Google Docs add-on for inserting links based on an URL and automatically format it with the title. Currently Google Docs doesn't have this functionality. This helper is currently only a RESTful service build with Node.js that retrieves the title from a URL. I took this approach because it is much difficult and unsupported to parse HTMLs from the Google Apps API.
